Mobile apps became one of the driving forces of modern civilization. Studies recently discovered that we spend more than 80% of our time on our mobile devices in mobile apps. As a result, bloggers are required to follow this trend and create a mobile app - otherwise they are not able to reach their audience. The most important feature of a mobile app is push notifications. Through them, bloggers can directly reach their audience. A mobile app has many advantages, however it is usually very expensive in development. Our aim was to create a real alternative and set a new standard in the process of creating a mobile app and we think that we succeeded. Two years ago, one member ran a blog and was desperatly looking for somebody that would develop him an mobile app for his blog. For the same reasons metioned above, he insisted on trying an mobile app in the form of an ios and android app because he was sure that a mobile app makes a huge difference in comparison to browsers. At first he did not find anybody who was able to develop his mobile app as an android app until he found the developer of our current team. We developed the mobile app together and it had tremendous success. We were so proud of our work and discovered a whole new world and everything that was possible in it - the world of mobile apps. What started as a little idea soon became a passion. We planned to build a company that provides the tools for bloggers to do the same. appful has been in development for 2 years and we are now very close friends. The love to mobile apps for ios and android and our passion is what keeps the company running. The times where you have to go to an agency and pay thousands of dollars to get a middle-class looking mobile app for ios and android are over. We provide you with a very affordable, stunning app for android and ios that can easily keep up with competitiors - more over your chances are good to get a very successful mobile app. We only take little fees to keep your app updated and running. Our mobile app company is now based in Germany and has a great success. We are very proud of what we already accomplished and looking forward to seeing what is going to follow. Be part of our story an try us free and get your own mobile app for your blog! In every area of our lives we recognize the trend to mobiles devices and smartphones. Mobile Devices (Android Apps and iOS Apps) are everywhere and they are talking over task by task. We use a mobile app for communication, a mobile app for entertainment, a mobile app for booking, a mobile app for eating, a mobile app photos, a mobile app for meeting new people and especially a mobile app for getting informations and news on both android and ios.
